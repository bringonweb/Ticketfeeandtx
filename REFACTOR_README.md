# TicketFeeAndTx Website Refactor

## Overview
This refactor transforms the flight booking website from skylinetravelsllc.com branding to ticketfeeandtx.com with a modern, trustworthy design system while preserving all booking logic, analytics, and core functionality.

## Key Changes

### Design System
- **New CSS Architecture**: Created `src/styles/tokens.css` with CSS variables for colors, spacing, typography, and responsive design
- **Modern Styling**: Replaced legacy styles with `modern-styles.css` using utility-first approach
- **Responsive Typography**: Implemented clamp() functions for fluid type scaling (320px-1440px+)
- **Color Palette**: Navy primary (#1e3a8a), sky-blue accent (#0ea5e9) for trustworthy travel aesthetic

### Components Created
1. **BookingSearchCard** - Enhanced form with validation, accessibility, and preserved booking logic
2. **PopularRoutes** - Grid of 6 flight deals with "View Deal" functionality
3. **FAQAccordion** - 6 travel-related questions with keyboard navigation
4. **TrustBar** - Value proposition badges (24×7 Agents, Transparent Fees, etc.)
5. **LegalRibbon** - Inline links to legal pages
6. **Modern Navbar** - Sticky navigation with mobile hamburger menu
7. **Modern Footer** - Four-column layout with contact information

### Accessibility Improvements
- Semantic HTML structure (header/nav/main/footer)
- ARIA attributes and labels throughout
- Keyboard navigation support
- Focus-visible outlines
- Screen reader announcements
- AA contrast compliance
- Reduced motion support

### Performance Optimizations
- Preload critical CSS resources
- Lazy loading for below-the-fold images
- System font stack with font-display: swap
- Optimized image sizing to prevent CLS
- Minimal JavaScript with modern ES6+

### Preserved Functionality
- **Booking Logic**: All form handlers and API calls maintained
- **Airport Suggestions**: Enhanced with better UX and accessibility
- **Analytics**: Schema.org structured data preserved
- **Email Integration**: send_booking.php integration intact
