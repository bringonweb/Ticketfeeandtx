              <p>Ticketfeeandtx shall not be held liable for any grievances arising from travel service providers, including but not limited to airlines, hotels, ground transportation, accommodations, or any financial instability of such providers. We cannot guarantee reimbursement for losses incurred due to the financial circumstances of any service provider. Should a supplier fail to honor agreements for which payment was processed, your primary recourse for compensation lies directly with that supplier or applicable third-party insurers.</p>

              <p>Ticketfeeandtx will not be responsible for fare changes, schedule modifications, equipment substitutions, or service cancellations that occur after ticket purchase. Ticketfeeandtx functions as an intermediary platform connecting retail travel suppliers with consumers. We maintain no operational control over, nor assume responsibility for, the actions of vendors from whom we source travel products. Post-issuance ticket modifications may incur penalties and fees. We do not control pricing structures on issued tickets, though some may display bulk fares (BT) or special rates that may vary from published fares. Available discounts may vary based on multiple factors including booking timing, availability, and supplier policies.</p>
